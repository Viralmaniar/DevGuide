# Input validation and output encoding

## Background
Majority of todayâ€™s applications get exploited because it fails to validate the input coming from users, files, 3rd party applications, infrastructure, external entities, database systems or by other processes. Almost every application on the web requires some sort of input from the listed entity. These input sources can be a great starting point for an attacker. Hence, all the inputs to an application must be checked and validated before processing it. 
## Principles (if any)


## Positive controls 

### Control
How to build a secure <thing> using Control to help you, including (or even just) UML diagrams. I prefer swim lanes, but as long as it prints in landscape mode, I'm cool. I don't want portrait diagrams as this is impossible to reflow automatically using our tools.

## Unit or Integration Test Cases

## Abuse Cases

## Negative patterns

### Control that should never ever appear under pain of infinite nyan cat

e.g. shared knowledge questions or answers, or dynamic SQL queries
